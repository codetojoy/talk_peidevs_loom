### Good

* Google Slides was a good choice (over Keynote)
    - screenshots of VS Code was good: plenty large for Startup Zone
* starting with code examples went well
* including structured concurrency was great 
* laser pointer ok for battery
    - unknown when last changed: 2019?
* fairly-well received

### Bad

* don't make jokes about UPEI without including Holland College
* should have highlighted more about nested thread hierarchies for structured concurrency
* should have highlighted more about the cancel/failure story of structured concurrency
    - one attendee seemed to think the point was submitting tasks to an executor?

### Indifferent

* jokes didn't really go over very well
    - meme gifs a la "better every loop" have typically done better
* free-range improv often works better
